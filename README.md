Hi, I'm Leon. This sole dragons mod is made with AI, and it is specifically Claude Sonnet 4.

This is just a past-time project of mine. Took one look at Bob Mowzie's Naga and Alex's Ice & Fire: Dragons and fell in love with those. So I think to myself, "How about I make my own Lightning Dragon and make it dodge while using other abilities too?" Then came the birth of this project. You can say that this project is HEAVILY inspired by Mowzie's Mobs and Ice & Fire: Dragons. Shout out to the amazing, talented, and smart folks over there and check those mods out too. And maybe I'll make more in the future.

Code work is all by AI. I have NOTHING to do with it. So, if you were to work with me, please don't ask me what the freak is public boolean and private static are about. Geez...
As for the dragon's (or wyvern's, for the flying reptiles nerds out there; you'll see why it's a wyvern if you have the mod) model, animations, and texture are all made by me with one inspiration from the franchise How To Train Your Dragon's Skrill. Gosh, I love that thing. So metal.

Thanks for taking your time to read this. And if you wanna contribute? Feel free to hit me up! I bet my left leg and my two kidneys you're a far better coder than I am. You worry about the code. Let me worry about the assets, or if you have a cooler design? Totally, why not?

As long as your contributions have stuff that are true to the dragon's image and behavior? Heck yeah! We're in this together and take as long as you need, cuz you're human too, and you got other stuff that are more important than this mod.
Again, just a past-time project. At this point... I don't know if you'd consider it "AI slop" or whatever...
