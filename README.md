# Saint's Dragons (0.0.5 preview)

Adds AI-driven companion dragons inspired by Mowzie’s Mobs and Ice & Fire. Models, textures, and animations by Leon, and code generated with AI and curated in-game.

## Dragons in this build
- Lightning Dragon – feature-complete rider with, melee, beam, and storm abilities (95% done)
- Primitive Drake – ground boi with play-dead behaviour and binder support (feature complete, I guess)
- Amphithere – aerial ambusher with magma volleys; missing sleep/ambient polish (88% done)
- Rift Drake – early prototype, spawn egg or commands only, no natural spawns yet (can still be ridden and you can swim with it!)

## Status & Roadmap
This is an early preview. Expect rough edges as Rift Drake animations are still WIP, ok?
Next up: finish Amphithere sleep/ambient set, add Rift Drake animations.

## Installation
1. Install Minecraft Forge 1.20.1 (47.4.0 or newer).
2. Add GeckoLib 4.8.1 to the mods folder.
3. Drop the `saintsdragons-0.0.5.jar` into your `mods` directory.

## Getting Started
- Craft or creative-grab the binders to tame and carry dragons.
- Use the Dragon Ally Book to whitelist friends (ally UI still missing hover + save features).
- Spawn Rift Drakes with `/summon saintsdragons:rift_drake` or their egg—no wild spawns yet.

## Known Issues
- Rift Drake lacks natural spawning and finished animations.
- Amphithere sleeps/ambience are placeholder.
