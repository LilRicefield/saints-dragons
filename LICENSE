Zap Van Dink (the dragon's name or whatever) Mod License

This mod is created and owned by Leon Saint/LilRicefield.  
You are welcome to use it, enjoy it, and include it in modpacks.  
But there are some rules.
---

YOU ARE ALLOWED TO:

- Use this mod freely and without charge. (I'm not Bethesda lmao)
- Include it in public or private modpacks, as long as you do not claim ownership.
- Use the mod’s textures, models, sounds, or assets, only if you clearly credit me.
- Share videos, streams, and content featuring the mod.
- Ask me to work with you as a co-dev. (I don't even code. I just use AI/Claude Sonnet 4, my brain for ideas and asking the AI to make those ideas, and then test them over and over again while learning a bit. But the model, animations, and textures are made by me.)

---

YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO:

- Modify or fork this mod without explicit permission from me.
- Re-upload the mod to other sites or platforms, even if unchanged. (bro, why do that at all)
- Claim the mod or its assets as your own.
- Monetize this mod or any derivative of it (no selling, paywalling, or Patreon gating, you're better than Bethesda).
- Use the mod’s assets in **commercial projects**.

CO-DEVELOPERS & PERMISSION

Only people I’ve explicitly added as co-developers or collaborators can:
- Edit the code or content
- Publish modified versions
- Help maintain or expand the project

If you're not one of them, then I bend your family over.

TL;DR:
Use it. Love it. Hate it. Don’t steal it. Don’t sell it. Credit where credit is due.
